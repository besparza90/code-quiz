# Code Quiz
## https://besparza90.github.io/module-4/

 After setting up introductory page with the button to start the quiz, I set up the different variable in the javascript doc. This included declaring the questions, answers, timer info, and queryselectors. A for loop is used to render the questions and answers. A function is also made to display if a selection was correct and to remove time if incorrect. An if else statement is also used to diplay questions or end the quiz.
 An event listner was added to count down the 60 seconds. An if statment is used to end the quiz if times expires. APIs like setAttribute and appendChild allow the user to input data upon completion. An event listener is made to store submitted info. The replace method is used to take the user to the score page.
 An additional html page is made to store the scores. Another js is made to retrive scores as well as clear them.
